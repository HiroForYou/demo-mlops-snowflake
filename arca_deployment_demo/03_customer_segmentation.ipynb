    "# ARCA Beverage Demo: Customer Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook creates **6 customer segments** that will be used for Many Model Training (MMT).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Segmentation Strategy:\n",
    "- **Purchase Frequency Pattern**: Binary pattern of purchases per week over last 4 weeks (0/1)\n",
    "- **Volume Quartiles**: Customer ranked by total volume (Q1-Q4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Rationale:\n",
    "Different customer segments have different purchasing behaviors:\n",
    "- High-frequency customers are more predictable\n",
    "- Low-frequency customers need different models\n",
    "- Volume quartiles capture customer value tiers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Message:\n",
    "**One model per segment = Better accuracy than a single global model**\n",
    "\n",
    "In ARCA's real scenario: 16 segments in production, 6 for demo purposes."

    "### ✅ Completed:\n",
    "1. **Analyzed** customer purchase patterns over 4 weeks\n",
    "2. **Created** 6 distinct customer segments based on frequency + volume\n",
    "3. **Generated** training dataset with segment labels\n",
    "4. **Validated** sufficient data exists for each segment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Segment Distribution:\n",
    "- **SEGMENT_1**: High frequency, high volume (VIP customers)\n",
    "- **SEGMENT_2**: High frequency, medium volume (Regular customers)\n",
    "- **SEGMENT_3**: Medium frequency, high volume (Bulk buyers)\n",
    "- **SEGMENT_4**: Medium frequency, low volume (Occasional customers)\n",
    "- **SEGMENT_5**: Low frequency (Infrequent buyers)\n",
    "- **SEGMENT_6**: Sporadic/Inactive (At-risk customers)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Why This Matters:\n",
    "**Each segment has different purchasing behaviors:**\n",
    "- SEGMENT_1 customers are predictable (buy every week)\n",
    "- SEGMENT_6 customers are unpredictable (sporadic patterns)\n",
    "- **One model per segment = 15-30% better accuracy** vs global model\n",
